# TFbScrapping

Browser extension and scraper for twitter and facebook 

## Context

More and more sites are implementing dynamic updates of their contents. New items are added as the user scrolls down. Twitter is one of these sites. Twitter only displays a certain number of news items initially, loading additional ones on demand. How can sites with this behavior be scraped?

## Instructions

Load the extension to your browser
A yellow icon now appears on your browser bar
Go to the Twitter or facebook's search page and enter your search keywords
Now press the start button
The scraping output is displayed on the console as JSON
